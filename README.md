A Veterinary Clinic appointment scheduler (C Language)

My first coding project, imports and manages patient records for a veterinary clinic and allows scheduling of future appointments for clients based on availability and office hours.
Supports viewing, searching, formatting, or changing patient and appointment data structures through menu interfaces
